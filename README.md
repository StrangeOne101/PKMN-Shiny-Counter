# PKMN-Shiny-Counter
Pokemon Shiny Counter - A chrome extension to count pokemon encounters when grinding shinies

Fetches the list of pokemon from pokemondb.net and imports it. Which is why although this was last updated in 2018, it has the latest pokemon.

Built on an old version of Chrome. It used to have the Alt + C (count) keybind to make it count up, but it doesn't work on modern chrome. Will need to be updated for the modern chrome extension format
